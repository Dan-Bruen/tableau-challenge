# tableau-challenge

## Objectives

I will design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). I may work with a timespan of my choosing. Optionally, I may merge multiple datasets from different periods.

Use my visualizations (does not have to be all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomena.

Create a dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year), with zip code data overlaid on the map.

Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
